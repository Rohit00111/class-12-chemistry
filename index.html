       <h4>Solution</h4>

1. A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more chemically non-reacting substances.
The components of a solution generally cannot be separated by filtration, settling or 

       <h4>Classification of solutio on basis of physical properties</h4>

2. A solution may be classified as solid, liquid or a gaseous solution.

 <h4>Solubility</h4>

3. Solubility is defined as the amount of solute in a saturated solution per 100g of a solvent.

         <h4>Factors affect solubiluity of gas</h4>

4. The solubility of a gas in a liquid depends upon
(a) the nature of the gas and the nature of the liquid,
(b) the temperature of the system, and
(c) the pressure of the gas.

 <h4>Raoults law</h4>

5. Thus, according to Raoult’s Law, the relative lowering of vapour pressure of a solution is equal to the mole fraction of the solute.

       <h4>Elevation in boiling point</h4>

6. For a dilute solution, the elevation in boiling point is found to be proportional to the molality of the

<h4>Depression in freezing point</h4>

7. The depression in freezing point (∆Tf) is proportional to the molality of the solution.
where Kf is molal depression constant (freezing point depression constant).

<h4>osmosis</h4>

8. The spontaneous flow of solvent molecules from a dilute solution into a concentrated solution when the two are separated by a perfect sernipermeable membrane is called osmosis.

<h4>Osmotic pressure</h4>

9. Osmotic pressure (π) is the pressure which must be applied to the solution side (more concentrated solution) to just prevent the passage of pure solvent into it through a sernipermeable membrane.
Mathematically, π = CRT= nB/V- RT
where n is the osmotic pressure of the solution,
C is the concentration of solution
nB is the number of moles of solute,
V is the volume of the solution in litres,
R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature on the Kelvin scale.

     <h4>Isotonic solution</h4>

10. Isotonic solutions are those solutions which have the same osmotic pressure. Also they have same molar concentration.
For isotonic solutions, π1 = π2 Also, C1 = C2
   
<h4>Vants law</h4>

11. Van’t Hoff factor, ‘ i’ is used to express the extent of association or dissociation of solutes in solution. It is die ratio of the normal and observed molar masses of the solute, i. e.,

<h4>inclusion of vants factor</h4>

12. Inclusion of van’t Hoff factor, ‘F, modifies the equations for colligative properties as follows:
